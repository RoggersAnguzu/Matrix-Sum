how to use italics in readme
ChatGPT
To use italics in a README file written in Markdown, you can enclose the text you want to appear in italics with asterisks * or underscores _. Here's how you do it:

markdown
Copy code
This is *italic* text.
or

markdown
Copy code
This is _italic_ text.
Both of these will render as:

This is italic text.

Keep in mind that Markdown rendering may vary slightly depending on the platform you are using to view the README (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.), but using asterisks or underscores for italics is a common Markdown convention that is supported by most platforms.


The program will display:

Sum of both the Matrices:
6 8
10 12

The program will display the sum of the two matrices.
